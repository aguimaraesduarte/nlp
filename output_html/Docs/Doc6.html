New Zealand is a unique place.
Not only does the island boast breathtaking landscapes and rare wildife – but, according to this video, it’s filled with out of control children driving cars filled with goats.
An understandably confused driver filmed the bizarre moment he tailed another car driven by a boy in Whitianga, New Zealand.
The local hilariously narrates the video Attenborough-style (but with extra swearing) and he can’t hide his disbelief as he realises who is driving the Ford Falcon.
He says: ‘I am currently following four eight-year-olds driving this Falcon.
s an eight-year-old driving this car, I s**t you not. It’s packed with kids, mate.’
That’s abnormal enough, but when he zooms in on the vehicle, things really take a turn for the weird
He adds: ‘And a goat. You’re f***ing kidding me! What the f**k is going on?
‘This is insane. Look at him, he can only just see over the steering wheel.’
Shortly after, the Falcon pulls up and our narrator stops alongside him, telling the boy ‘you shouldn’t be driving’, prompting him to nervous scramble out of the other side of the car.
Meanwhile, a man, possibly the boy’s dad, climbs out of the back and, with unsettling calmness, explains that everything is fine and the boy is ‘training’.
Sadly, what on earth the goat was doing in the back will likely forever remain a mystery.
